# Spoken Language Identification using uVector

This repository contails the Python script of a graphical user interface (GUI) and the command line interface (CLI) for Spoken Language Identification using uVector and uVector with WSSSL models. The GUI allows users to perform various tasks such as recording audio, playing saved audio files, and identifying the language of spoken audio using both standard uVector and WSSL uVector models. 

The CLI also identify the language of spoken audio using both standard uVector and WSSL uVector models, but it takes either a single audio file or a directory containing multiple audio files as input. 

Both task uses the pre-trained models to identify the language of the spoken audio.
